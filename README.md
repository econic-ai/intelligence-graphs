# Intelligence Graphs

Intelligence Graphs augment AI systems by structuring knowledge, memory, reasoning, and other information as interconnected graph relationships. This repository contains reference implementations and research materials for developing Intelligence Graph systems.

## Overview

Intelligence Graphs extend beyond traditional knowledge retrieval (like Graph RAG) to create comprehensive frameworks that integrate:

- **Knowledge Graphs**: Structured facts and concepts
- **Memory Graphs**: Persistent tracking of interactions and context
- **Reasoning Graphs**: Problem-solving patterns and templates
- **Game Graphs**: Multi-agent coordination structures
- **Learning Graphs**: Temporal representations of knowledge evolution

These approaches provide more efficient alternatives to scaling neural networks, offering greater transparency and reduced computational requirements while enabling key capabilities needed for advanced AI systems.

## Key Benefits

- **Computational Efficiency**: Order of magnitude smaller than large neural models
- **Persistent Context**: Beyond fixed context window limitations
- **Personalisation**: Individual and organisational knowledge adaptation
- **Complex Reasoning**: Structured approaches to multi-step problems
- **Multi-Agent Coordination**: Optimal collective intelligence frameworks
